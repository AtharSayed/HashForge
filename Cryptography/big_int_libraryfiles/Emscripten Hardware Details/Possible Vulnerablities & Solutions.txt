 Vulnerabilities :

1) Unauthorized Access 
2) Man in Middle Attack
3) Memory Safety 
4) Cross Side Scripting 
5) Sensitive Data exposure

Solutions :

1) Encrpyting the file before sending wheter it is secure or unsecure network in both case  
2) If the data is sensitive in this case the file data is sensitive then it is
better to encrypted the data to prevent data exposure.
3) It is important to have a proper secured network to avoid Man in the middle attack 
4) To make sure we use strong encryption algorithm
