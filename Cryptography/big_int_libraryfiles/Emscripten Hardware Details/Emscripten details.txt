Emscripten does not supports windows api the reason are as follows : 

1) Web browsers are designed to prevent websites from accessing sensitive information on a user's system, such as hardware information like serial numbers. 
   This is done to protect users from potential security risks. 

Solution (Not reliable)
1) There exists a possiblity to even access the hardware details of the users through emscripten 
   by using third party libraries and api now for api we need to look into the the specifications and according to the specifications the api will vary for different laptops so i cannot 
   give that API to another person to access his hardware specifications.The API will vary from machine to machine.
